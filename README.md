### Objective 

Party planning sometimes is all about choosing the right color. Before we can do anything about choosing the decor, food and dressing code, we have to make a decision: what colors best represent this event and speak for the event? Simple is powerful. Why not just start with one picture? Upload an image which you like, and we will provide you a color scheme matching your image, further more, we will be able to provide images having the similar color scheme!

We empower our user with the ability to focus by extracting the top N colors (N is decided by user) and help our user to explore by offering a set of similar pictures to inspire sparkling ideas.

### How to run the program

* For the ease of use, we combined all the functions in one file -- MainMethodRun.java.
* If you hit “run” in MainMethodRun.java, you will be prompted to enter the name of your image and an integer (should be ranged from 5 to 7) which indicates how many colors you want to get in the color scheme.
* The format of image name should be “xxx.jpg”, also the image needs to be in the same project folder. There are 11 sample test images in our java folder for your use.
* To get the optimized result for the recommended images, we set the range of user input integer to be 5-7.
* Hope you enjoy our color scheme program.
